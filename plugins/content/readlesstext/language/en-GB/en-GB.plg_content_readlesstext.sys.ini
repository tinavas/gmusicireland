PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_DESCRIPTION="<h2>v5.2 (r274)</h2><p><em>read less text</em> will control the article text: preview size, formatting and image placement can be adjusted to your liking, precisely on those pages and for those articles or items you want. <em>read less text</em> will not alter your article tables in any way. Only the display is controlled: uninstalling or disabling will bring back the original text.</p><p><em>It is advised to use the <code>Discover</code> mode should you want fine-grained control on when and where read less text is to be active. You can enable and disable the <code>Discover</code> mode in the section <code>When active</code>.</em></p><p>This version does not affect the article's titles. If you want to control the title length, prepend or append specific information, and adjust the casing of the title, you can install and use the separate extension <em><a href='http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/style-a-design/titles/16619/'>read less title.</a></em></p><p>A companion plugin <em><a href='http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/cutoff/frs/'>read less text again</a></em> lets you define a second set of settings: whenever you want articles to be shortened or reformatted differently depending on the page they are shown, or depending on the location on the page they are shown, this companion plugin is made for you.</p><h2>Contexts - Quick</h2> <p>Check the table below to quickly configure the plugin: <table><tr><th><code>When Active</code> &gt; <code>Allowed</code></th> <th><em>only</em> active on</th></tr> <tr><td><code>frontpage</code></td> <td>the frontpage of your site</td></tr> <tr><td><code>category</code></td> <td>all the category blog pages</td></tr> <tr><td><br /><code>category=12</code></td> <td>the blog page of<br />the category with id 12</td></tr> <tr><td><code>135</code></td> <td>the article with id 135 <br /> on all blog and article pages</td></tr> </table></p> <ul><li>Most users will want to activate <em>read less text</em> for all the article blog pages. They can choose to select the quick configuration in which case the fields <code>Allowed</code> and <code>Disallowed</code> will be ignored.</li> <li><em>read less text</em> can not be active on a list layout of articles - this is a technical limitation.</li> <li>It is possible to be active on a list layout of other components - this entirely depends on the implementation of that component.</li></ul> <h2>Tokens</h2> <p><em>read less text</em> can add specific HTML both in front and at the end of each article. Both prefix and suffix may contain <em>token</em>s. A <em>token</em> is a special keyword that is surrounded by curly brackets. <ul>The following <em>tokens</em> are recognized: <li><code>{title}</code>, <code>{id}</code>, <code>{url}</code><br /><code>{author}</code>, <code>{author_id}</code><br /><code>{words}</code>, <code>{hits}</code><br /><code>{created}</code>, <code>{modified}</code>, <code>{publish_up}</code><br /i><code>{category}</code>, <code>{category_id}</code><br /><code>{component}</code></li></ul></p> <p><em>Token</em>s are replaced for each article, using the article's specific information. Those tokens that are replaced with dates will be formatted according to the format you provide in the field <code>Date Format</code>. You can review the <a href='http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php'>manual for the function <code>date</code></a> for a list of formatting characters and their explanation, and for a list of examples.<br/>The <code>{title}</code> token can be displayed shortened as well: if you use <a href='index.php?option=com_plugins&view=plugins&filter_search=read'><em>read less title</em></a>, and have ensured that the ordering number is lower than the ordering number of <em>read less text</em>, the shortened title will be used. This will work even if you selected not to display titles under <code><a href='index.php?option=com_content'>Article Manager</a> &gt; Options &gt; Articles</code> by setting the option <code>Show Title</code> to <code>Hide</code>.</p> <h2>Contexts - Slow</h2> <p> You can very precisely configure when this plugin may be active and when not. This is done by listing <em>contexts</em> in the <code>Allowed</code> and <code>Disallowed</code> fields. A <em>context</em> is simply a combination of a component name, the name of a view and an article id, separated by a single colon <code>:</code>.<ul><li>The component name may be omitted - in that case <code>com_content</code> is assumed.</li> <li>The view name may be omitted - in that case it is assumed all views are targeted.</li> <li>The article id may be omitted - in that case it is assumed all articles on the page are targeted.</li><li>The last part, where the article id can be given, has one special shortcut: <code>all-in-&lt;n&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> is to be replaced with the id of a category. In that case all articles in the given category <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> are targeted.</li> </ul></p> <p>The table above already gave some examples. Should you want a very fine-grained control: you easily can.</p> <h2>Contexts - Discover</h2> <p>To know if it is possible for <em>read less text</em> to operate on a specific page, and to know the precise component name and view which is used on that page, you can enable the <code>Discover</code> mode. In <code>Discover</code> mode, <em>read less text</em> will replace the article's text or any component's <em>Item</em> text - if applicable - with the information you need to be able to fully verify and adjust your configuration.</p> <p>The <code>Discover</code> mode is only applied for users which have back-end access: you can thus safely activate the option and still be assured all your regular users continue to see your site as intended.</p> <h2>Contexts - Two more examples</h2> <p>Suppose you have as configuration:</p> <table><tr><th>Field</th> <th>Value</th></tr> <tr><td><code>Quick Configuration</code></td> <td><code>No, use the fields below</code></td></tr> <tr><td><code>Allowed</code></td> <td><code>frontpage, category, com_eventlist:venues</code></td></tr> <tr><td><code>Disallowed</code></td> <td><code>38, 245, 246, category=7, com_eventlist:venues:28</code></td></tr></table></p> <p> <ul>In this case <em>read less text</em> will:<li>Never be active on the text of the articles with id 38, 245 and 246, regardless where and on what kind of page the article is shown.</li> <li>Not be active when displaying the blog page of category 7.</li> <li>Be active on all articles on all other blog pages, including any category blog page within category 7.</li> <li>Be active on the articles on the frontpage except the articles with id 38, 245 and 246.</li> <li>Be active on all venues on all EventList's detailed venue list pages except for the specific venue with id 28</li></ul></p> <p>Suppose you have as configuration:</p> <table><tr><th>Field</th> <th>Value</th></tr> <tr><td><code>Restrict Access For Guests</code></td> <td><code>Yes</code></td></tr> <tr><td><code>Quick Configuration</code></td> <td><code>No, use the fields below</code></td></tr> <tr><td><code>Allowed</code></td> <td><code>blog, categories, category, featured</code></td></tr> <tr><td><code>Disallowed</code></td> <td><code>all-in-7</code></td></tr></table></p> <p> <ul>In this case <em>read less text</em> will:<li>Active on all content blog pages when a user is logged in,</li> <li>always be active on all content pages when a user is <em>not</em> logged in (i.e. is a guest),</li> <li><em>except</em> for all articles in category <code>7</code>, which <em>read less text</em> will never try to shorten - not even for guests, regardless the page on which they are shown.</li></ul></p><hr/><h2>Thank you!</h2><ul>You can show your appreciation - should there be any - by<li><em>helping yourself</em>. <a href='http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/cutoff/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse&tracker_id=9352'>Report bugs</a> and <a href='http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/cutoff/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse&tracker_id=9351'>request missing functionality</a>: everybody's time is limited, but most likely you won't get what you don't ask for.</li><li><em>helping other administrators</em>. <a href='http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/news-display/article-elements/articles-summary/12432'>Rate my extension</a> and leave a correct review: the height of the rating and the tone of the reviews are important decision factors for potential new users.</li><li><em>helping me</em>. <a href='https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=L9P4GMDWRKGUN'>Make a donation (PayPal)</a>: any gift is gratefully accepted, and you can be sure to have boosted my motivation!</li></ul>"
