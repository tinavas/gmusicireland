When a page is built, the output of any component - not just <code>com_content</code> - can contain article text. In most cases, this component allows plugins like <em>read less text</em> to intervene, to enhance the output (technical: the <code>onContentBeforeDisplay</code> event is fired). Some examples are <em>Eventlist</em> (<code>com_eventlist</code>) and <em>FJ Related Articles Blog and List Component</em> (<code>com_fjrelated</code>).<br />With this option you can choose if <em>read less text</em> must follow the context rules below, or may never be active on any component output.

PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_CROP_HORIZONTAL_POSITION_DESCRIPTION="When the ratio of the original image sizes and the ratio of the desired thumbnail sizes are not equal <em>(which is nearly always)</em>, we can crop in one direction, cutting of the extraneous portion of the image. The resulting resized image then has the exact desired thumbnail sizes.

PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_DISCOVER="<strong>Discover</strong>"
PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_DISCOVER_DESCRIPTION="Enabling this replaces the article's text with all information you need to configure the options in this section. <br/><strong>Only users that are allowed back-end access will see any effect: <br/>your normal users will continue to see the articles as intended.</strong> <br/>With this extra information, you can find out whether the plugin is active on each article, and what the precise <br/>context strings are for each article.

With this option you can choose if <em>read less text</em> must always be active on any module output, only active if the contexts below allow this, or never be active on any module output.

PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_RESPECT_EXISTING_READMORE_LINK="Respect Position<br />Existing <em>Read More</em>"
PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_RESPECT_EXISTING_READMORE_LINK_DESCRIPTION="Choose what to do when an article already contains a manually inserted <em>Read More</em> link. <ul>You can choose to:<li><strong>Ignore it</strong>: select <code>No</code>.<br />The article will be shortened as if the <em>Read More</em> link was not present.</li><li><strong>Respect it</strong>: select <code>Yes</code>.<br />The text before the <em>Read More</em> link - the <em>intro text</em> - will be used as shortened text: the article will <em>not</em> be shortened using <br/>the length settings above, but at the position of the existing <em>Read More</em> link. The text will be considered shortened - this <br/>'property' is used when determining whether to add a thumbnail, prefix, inline suffix and suffix.</li><li><strong>Use it as an additional upper limit</strong>: select <code>Use it to respect 'Show Intro Text'</code>.<br />If you selected to hide the intro text when displaying an article in full under <code><a href='index.php?option=com_content'>Article Manager</a> &gt; Options &gt; Articles</code> by <br/>setting the option <code>Show Intro Text</code> to <code>Hide</code>, the shortening of the article will be based on the intro text <em>only</em>. <br/>The remainder of the article - the part after the read more token - will then never appear in the shortened text.<br />Normally, the option <code>Show Intro Text</code> will hide the intro text when displaying a single article on a page (provided <br/><em>read less text</em> is not allowed to run on that page). If you select this option, <em>read less text</em> uses the reverse meaning: <br/><em>only</em> the intro text will be considered on all pages where <em>read less text</em> is allowed to run.<br />The text will <em>not</em> be considered shortened if the full intro text is retained - but it will do so, should parts of the intro text be omitted.</li></ul><strong>Note:</strong> This choice does not affect other settings: e.g. the <em>Read More</em> text and styling as configured on this page are still applied, <br/>regardless of this setting.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> Searching for a thumbnail will always be done in the full article, regardless of this setting."
PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_RETAIN_WHOLE_WORDS="Whole words"
PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_RETAIN_WHOLE_WORDS_DESCRIPTION="Enable this to retain whole words only.

According to the settings in the other sections, a thumbnail, a prefix, inline suffix and/or suffix may be added as a result.<br /><strong>Example:</strong> If you use the extension plugin <em>EmbedChessboard</em>, you may have added something like <code>[pgn]chess moves[/pgn]</code> to your content article.
